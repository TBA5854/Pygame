going to create a platformer
everything is going slow for beginners
here we go ?
coords start from left top corner to right bottom corner
an idea for scrolling bg :
move the image backward ,  then redraw the image as soon as it ends
if the image is completely off screen then reset it to 0
the event  is goig kind of slowwww fixing others errors 
i was correct about the image scrolling
now its going very technical for beginners
